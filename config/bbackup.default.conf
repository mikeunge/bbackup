# These values are the MOST important!
# Make sure the share exists and is available and also create the mounting point.
# The mounting point should be equal the destination in the rsnapshot.conf file, if not, you will have trouble executing the script properly.
# You can toggle if the script should mount a network share or not, just change the MOUNT_ENABLED to 0 and it'll get
# skipped.
# If the drive should be unmounted after the backup finished, change UMOUNT to 1.

# You can define a second backup job with a different  network drive to be mounted.
# The script will check if the passed argument is the same value as the SEC_TASK value.
# If the values are the same, the SEC_SHARE is going to be set as the main share to use.
# Change the SEC_MOUNT to another directory (if you want to).
# This can be very helpfull if you want to execute a different kind of backup without touching the rsnapshot configuration file.

# COMP_SRC => defines the source(s) what the script takes as input.
# COMP_TMP => all the files/folders are going to be stored in here.
# COMP_REM => set this flag if the script should delete existing files in the COMP_TMP path.
# COMP_MOD => change the compression mode (tar, bz2|bzip2, gz|gzip, lzma). (default: bz2)
# COMP_LVL => define the compression level; will only take action if COMP_MOD is not tar! (default: 3)
